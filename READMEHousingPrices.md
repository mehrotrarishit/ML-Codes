#Project:Ames Housing Prices Prediction

##Install
 
This project requires Python and its following libraries to be installed.

*NumPy
*Pandas
*matplotlib
*scikit-learn

The code can be run on Google Colab. Otherwise you need to install software to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

##Code

The code uses the Ames Housing Dataset to predict the housing prices. The code uses Random Forest Regressor to predict the prices. It also uses arious pandas commands to process the data to fit it in the model.

##Data

The dataset used is the Ames Housing Dataset by Dean de Cock. This Dataset has 1459 data points. Each datapoint had 76 columns. However after processing and analysing the data many of them were dropped. However to make the features with dtype as object useful it was necessary to encode them. This increased the number of features. The label in the dataset was SalePrice.
